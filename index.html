                      <p>
                        I propose two questions.<br><br>
                        Firstly, <b>have you ever had those dreams where you're sinking in an endless ocean?</b> <br><br>
                        The prospect is unsurprisingly terrifying to a lot of people. It's an endless, unpredictable void. 
                        I've always thought the deep dark was a place of comfort. 
                        A book about the ocean was the first non-fiction book I can ever remember reading. 
                        <br><br>
                        I lost my interest in the ocean as I turned more towards the world of technology. I've finally made my way back.
                        <br><br>
                        My second question is this - <b>how do you provide information in a convenient and accessible way?</b>
                        <br><br>
                        There have been many resources that attempt to answer this question. Some might turn to TV shows, some books. 
                        The reality is though, that <b>technology is inevitable</b>. Scrolling down and clicking a button is as widespread of a language as English is.
                        <br><br>
                        Technology is scary to learn because it's unfamiliar. But just like how we overcome our fears of the dark through knowledge, we come to learn about this unknown and realise it's not all that bad. 
                        <br><br>
                        This is both a tribute to both my younger self, fascinated by the ocean, and a showcase of how we can use technology to learn about science.

                <p>
                    Located between 200m - 1000m, less than 1% of sunlight reaches this zone. As a result, many organisms produce their own light, referred to as bioluminescence.</p>
                <p>Temperatures vary from 4°C to 20°C.

                <p>The largest migration on Earth occurs every day from the twilight zone; many organisms living in this zone move up to the surface to feed at night, before returning back to the safer, darker depths as day comes around.</p>

                <p>There's a common phenomenon as you get deeper into the ocean where deep-sea animals tend to be larger than their shallow-water relatives.</p>
                <p>This is called "deep-sea gigantism" and is thought to be correlated with a number of factors, such as:</p>

                    <li>
                        <b>Surface area to volume ratios</b> -> larger animals have less surface area to volume, so they lose less body heat than those with smaller bodies, which may be relevant to the cooler temperatures of the twilight zone

                    <h2>Location</h2>
                    <p>Most giant isopod species are found at depths of 365m - 730m, although the known lowest depth it was found was at ~2140m. </p>
                    <p>These species are typically found in the colder waters of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific ocean.</p>

                <sl-carousel-item>
                    <h2>Morphology</h2>
                    <p>Like many arthropods, giant isopods feature a calcium carbonate exoskeleton made of overlapping segments, designed to protect it from predators. They also curl up when threatened.</p>
                    <p>Typically they are 19-36cm long, although the longest confirmed length is ~50cm. They are usually pink or pale lilac in colour.</p>

                    <p>Their antenna are mainly used for sensing motion - particularly useful for completely dark environments such as the twilight zone.</p>
                    <p>Their eyes are spaced out, large, triangular and compound with over 4000 individual facets. However, the extent to which they use their eyes is unclear since there is very little light in the twilight zone.</p>

                        Giant isopods are scavengers and predators; food is scarce in the

                        regions of the twilight zone so this creature will take any opportunity it can to feed.
                    </span>
                    <p>They have been known to gorge on food to the point that they are unable to move and are capable of surviving 5 years in captivity without food. This is supported by substantial fat reserves in their midgut glands, which works as storage for when they cannot find food and eat.</p>

                <sl-carousel-item>
                    <h2>Feeding</h2>
                    <p>Their diets include dead whales, fish and squid - animals that have died in the surface layer and floated down to the seafloor in the twilight zone.</p>
                    <p>They can also feed on live shrimps and squat lobsters; slow moving animals present at the seafloor.</p>
                </sl-carousel-item>
                <sl-carousel-item>
                    <h2>Reproduction</h2>
                    <p>Giant isopods reproduce seasonally via egg laying, generally during spring and winter when food is more abundant. Mature females develop a pouch where 20-30 eggs are stored until the young (Manca) are ready to emerge These eggs are approximately 1.2cm in diameter.</p>
                    <p>Manca come out fully developed and are distinguished through their lacking of the last pair of pereopods. They can also reach up to 6cm in length. These younger isopods shed their exoskeletons often to grow, after which malting either reduces greatly or stops altogether.</p>
